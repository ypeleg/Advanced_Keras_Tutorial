    "Deep residual networks took the deep learning world by storm when Microsoft Research released Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition. These networks led to 1st-place winning entries in all five main tracks of the ImageNet and COCO 2015 competitions, which covered image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. The robustness of ResNets has since been proven by various visual recognition tasks and by non-visual tasks involving speech and language.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Network depth is of crucial importance in neural network architectures, but deeper networks are more difficult to train. The residual learning framework eases the training of these networks, and enables them to be substantially deeper — leading to improved performance in both visual and non-visual tasks. These residual networks are much deeper than their ‘plain’ counterparts, yet they require a similar number of parameters (weights).\n",
    "The (degradation) problem:\n",
    "With network depth increasing, accuracy gets saturated (which might be unsurprising) and then degrades rapidly. Unexpectedly, such degradation is not caused by overfitting, and adding more layers to a suitably deep model leads to higher training error.\n",
    "The core insight:\n",
    "Let us consider a shallower architecture and its deeper counterpart that adds more layers onto it. There exists a solution to the deeper model by construction: the layers are copied from the learned shallower model, and the added layers are identity mapping. The existence of this constructed solution indicates that a deeper model should produce no higher training error than its shallower counterpart.\n",
    "#### The proposed solution:\n",

    "A residual block — the fundamental building block of residual networks. Figure 2: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf\n",
    "Instead of hoping each stack of layers directly fits a desired underlying mapping, we explicitly let these layers fit a residual mapping. The original mapping is recast into F(x)+x. We hypothesize that it is easier to optimize the residual mapping than to optimize the original, unreferenced mapping. To the extreme, if an identity mapping were optimal, it would be easier to push the residual to zero than to fit an identity mapping by a stack of nonlinear layers.\n",
    "We have reformulated the fundamental building block (figure above) of our network under the assumption that the optimal function a block is trying to model is closer to an identity mapping than to a zero mapping, and that it should be easier to find the perturbations with reference to an identity mapping than to a zero mapping. This simplifies the optimization of our network at almost no cost. Subsequent blocks in our network are thus responsible for fine-tuning the output of a previous block, instead of having to generate the desired output from scratch."
